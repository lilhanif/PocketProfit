üìù Project Context & Tech Choices
This project was developed as a university assignment for a Financial Management course. A key requirement for submission is to have a live, demonstrable version hosted on GitHub Pages

Since GitHub Pages only serves static files and does not support server-side code or direct database connections, a traditional backend was not feasible for this hosting environment. To showcase the application's dynamic features (like adding/deleting transactions and goals) in a persistent manner, localStorage was chosen. It acts as a client-side database, allowing the app to be fully interactive and functional for demonstration purposes directly within the browser

üíª Tech Stack
HTML: For the basic structure of the web pages

Tailwind CSS: For styling and rapidly building a modern, responsive user interface

JavaScript  For all interactive logic, DOM manipulation, and application functionality

Chart.js: A library used to create interactive and informative charts
